I make things -- usually software, but sometimes also hardware, videos, and
music. On this site, I document the process of making these things and
interesting (and occasionally unrelated) adventures that happen along the way.

You can also find me on:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/aarmea/)
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnhhM5-D-hMGzNH_zk8vVwg)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/aarmea)

... or you can [send me an email](mailto:website@albertarmea.com).

My resume can be found [here](/docs/resume.pdf).
